<h2><a href = "https://github.com/ccspringer/CGE-in-JuMP">CGE-in-JuMP</a></h2>
<p>CGE-in-JuMP is a simple computable general equilibrium model implemented with the Julia for Mathematical Optimization (JuMP) interface. This model uses the JuMP package with the Ipopt solver to demonstrate an open-source alternative to GAMS for CGE models.</p>

<h2><a href = "http://datadiversity.berkeley.edu/index.html">Data and Diversity</a></h2>
<p>Data and Diversity was a fall 2015 project-based course for undergraduates designed and taught by myself and several other graduate students. The goal of the course was to use data science to better understand how science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) departments can create more equitable, inclusive, and diverse learning environments. Working with clients from the Berkeley Institute for Data Science and the UC Berkeley Office of Equity, Inclusion, and Diversity, students analyzed data and recommended solutions on STEM and diversity at UC Berkeley. We hope that the final reports, syllabus, and course materials, available on <a href="datadiversity.berkeley.edu">the website</a>, will be valuable to others.</p>
