<h2><a href = "https://github.com/ccspringer/CGE-in-JuMP">CGE-in-JuMP</a></h2>
<p>CGE-in-JuMP is a simple computable general equilibrium model implemented with the Julia for Mathematical Optimization (JuMP) interface. This model uses the JuMP package with the Ipopt solver to demonstrate an open-source alternative to GAMS for CGE models.</p>
